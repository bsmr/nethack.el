;;; Commentary:

;; Here are some hacks that illustrate the power of nethack and emacs
;; combined.

;;; Code:

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
(defun nethack-x-timestamp-message ()
  "Add a time-stamp to every message.

Add the following to your ~/.emacs

  (add-hook 'nethack-before-print-message-hook 
	    'nethack-x-timestamp-message)"
  (insert (format "(%d) " (elt nh-status-attribute-T 0))))
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
(defun nethack-x-gdb ()
  "Debug running nethack process with gdb."
  (interactive)
  (gdb (format "gdb %s/nethack %d"
	       nh-directory
	       (process-id nh-proc))))

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs
;; (add-hook 'nethack-status-attribute-change-functions 'nethack-x-warn-low-hp)
(defun nethack-x-warn-low-hp (attr new old)
  "Print a message in `nh-message-buffer' when hitpoints get low."
  (if (and (string-equal attr "HP")
	   (< new old)
	   (< (/ new (float (car nh-status-attribute-HPmax))) 0.20))
      (nhapi-message 'atr-blink "Hitpoints below 20%")))

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; add the following to your ~/.emacs
;; (add-hook 'nethack-add-menu-hook 'nethack-x-highlight-option)
(defvar nethack-x-highlights '((" blessed " . nethack-green-face)
			       (" holy " . nethack-green-face)
			       (" cursed " . nethack-red-face)
			       (" unholy " . nethack-green-face)
			       (" cursed .* (being worn)" . nethack-orange-face))
  "An assoc of regexps and font colors")

(defun nethack-x-highlight-option ()
  "Highlight a nethack menu option based on a regexp."
  ;; Move to the beginning of the option just added
  (save-excursion
    (let (start
	  (end (point)))
    (forward-line -1)
    (forward-line 0)
    ;; A mini-hack so the option accelerator doesn't get highlighted
    (setq start (+ (point) 4))
    (mapc (lambda (x)
	    (if (re-search-forward (car x) nil t)
		(put-text-property start end 'face (cdr x))))
